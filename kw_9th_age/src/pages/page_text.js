  'civilization'. This term is relative though as a civilized Vampire Count encampment resembles a civilized
  Highborn Elf city in name only. The region of KWL battles for constant supremecy in The 9th Age
  sub-continent of Kea'wole (prounounce KAY-a-wool). The only common theme between regions is that
  there is no theme: mountains give way to swampland which, in turn, meanders into a grassy plain.
  Barren rockland is just as abundant as lush forests and farmland.

  castles. Kea'wole is an unconquered land of unknown opportunity. Sally forth your armies and immortalize your
  name on the scrolls of history!
